auth choices: complexity ----> increases
(doesnt mean less complex is not good)

	session -- json web tokens -- OAuth -- Other/Ad-hoc
								/	\
						  In-house	 SaaS

jwt and session based -
	its about who the user is? - authentication

things like sign in with google, github - 
	they are AUTHORIZATION
	- who has access to what resources (get or get/post, etc)
	- defined by scopes in access tokens

OAuth - protocol (confusing as Auth0 is SaaS provider)
	- it seperates 2 components of user authentication


## video 2

http headers - 3 types(general, req, res)

	request headers - sent by browser
		ex> Cookie: connect.sid=abc123

			- 	req.headers
				req.get("Authorization")


	response headers - sent by server
		ex> Set-Cookie: connect.sid=abc123; HttpOnly
		- server tells client it wants these cookies
		- key-value pairs
		- now browser says that every request we make
			in this domain will have to have this
			cookie set
		- now req headers will have those cookies
		- set cookie has expires= key to set how long

		-	
			//this adds a response header
			res.set("X-Powered-By", "Express");

			//below sets cookie
			//internally express sends ser-cookie res header
			res.cookie("token", "abc");

- session and cookie

- Cookie
	- cookie has it data stored in browser
	- browser is going to attach that cookie(key-val)
		to every request it sends

- session
	- session is stored on server side(express js appln)
	- can store more data than cookie
	- can store private data like credentials

- session store
	- what persistent memory we want to store sesh in
	- by default it uses in appln memory(memoryStore)
	- set up session store == connect db to express-session middleware

//secret is used to create signature
//connect.sid=<seshId>.<signature>
//if secret changed all sessions invalidated

//passport adds 
	"passport":{"user":8}}
to session when a user logs in
- user id bcz of serialize function
- later user id taken from session by deserialize function
	to populate req.user
- this is made sure by app.use(passport.session())

- passport.authenticate calls req.login automatically
- req.logout() we have to call
- it deletes req.session.passport.user

- req.isAuthenticated: checks if above prop is not null
